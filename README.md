-----------------------------------------------------------

In this course, a final programming project will take the place of formal exams to test your understanding of the material.  
The final project will involve working with a team of 3-4 people to implement a substantial web app that utilizes all of the major components 
of the web application stack covered in this class.  Specifically, you and your teammates will write a web app that satisfies 
all of these requirements:

The app uses HTML and CSS to implement a well-designed client interface.
The app uses client-side JS to enable relevant user interactions with the client interface.
The app is served using a Node.js-based (or other approved) serving stack.
The app dynamically generates pages based on data stored in a back end data store, such as MongoDB.
The app’s client interface communicates with the app’s server to create, read, update, and/or delete content in the back end data store.

Within those boundaries, your team may write any kind of web app you want.  There are infinite possibilities, and I encourage 
you to be creative and to implement an application you find interesting or that solves a real problem for some set of 
potential users.  Below are some guidelines and logistics for the final project.



Be realistic about your project
Importantly, you should also be realistic about what you can actually accomplish with a small team in a few weeks.  
In particular, feel free to treat the final project as an opportunity to deliver a prototype, not a polished product.  
If you’re having trouble thinking of an idea for an app to implement, please reach out to me, and I can help you figure 
something out.

One thing in particular you should be cautious of is implementing an app that requires user authentication and logged-in 
sessions.  Getting the details of these things right can be tricky, and I don’t want you to get bogged down in these details.  
Implementing logins is not needed for the kind of prototype you’ll implement for this project.  If you do want to implement 
authentication and logged-in sessions, you must discuss with me to get approval.


Third-party libraries and other tools
You may treat the final project as an opportunity to learn how to use web development technologies we didn’t cover in class.  
Specifically, if there’s a third-party tool or library you want to use for the project (e.g. Bootstrap, React, Angular, 
Webpack, ES 6/7, Socket.io, etc.), feel free to do so, as long as that third-party code doesn’t completely implement your final project.
